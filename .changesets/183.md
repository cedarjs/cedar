- feat(cli): Use vite-node for exec (#183) by @Tobbe

Use https://www.npmjs.com/package/vite-node for running CedarJS scripts.

⚠️ `yarn rw exec` no longer uses your custom Babel plugins if you have any.
Please let me know if this is an issue for you and I'll help you move those to
Vite plugins instead if needed.
