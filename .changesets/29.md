- chore(cli): Make baremetal safe to import in cli (#29) by @Tobbe

Breaking for the same reason as https://github.com/redmix-run/redmix/pull/28 â€“
people might potentially (but most likely not) depend on (internal) exports that
no longer exists

The following functions and constants were previously exported from
`.../deploy/baremetal.js` and have now been moved to
`.../deploy/baremetal/baremetalHandler.js`  

```
DEFAULT_SERVER_CONFIG
throwMissingConfig
verifyConfig
verifyServerConfig
serverConfigWithDefaults
maintenanceTasks
rollbackTasks
lifecycleTask
commandWithLifecycleEvents
deployTasks
parseConfig
commands
```

If you're using any of these exports, please know that they will probably be
removed in a future release. Do let us know if you need them, and if so, what
you use them for.
