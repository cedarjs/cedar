- feat(esm): `@cedarjs/testing` dual ESM/CJS build (#163) by @Tobbe

This PR allows both CJS and ESM projects to use the `@cedarjs/testing` package.
Among other things it does this by adding `exports` to the package.json file.

⚠️ The goal is that this change should be non-breakable, but if you're doing
dist imports from `@cedarjs/testing` it might be. Please let me know in that
case and I'll fix it.
