- feat(jobs): Cron jobs (#180) by @Tobbe

You can create cron jobs like this. It will run at 2 AM every night Mon-Fri

```ts
import { jobs } from 'src/lib/jobs'

export const NightlyReportJob = jobs.createJob({
  queue: 'default',
  cron: '* 2 * * 1-5',
  perform: async () => {
    await DailyUsageReport.run()
  },
})
```

Then you just have to schedule it somehow, same as regular jobs.
Here's an example

```ts
const scheduleJob = jobs.createScheduler({
  adapter: 'prisma',
})

scheduleJob(NightlyReportJob)
```
