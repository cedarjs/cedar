- feat(deps): Upgrade (#109) by @Tobbe

This PR is a breaking change. It upgrades Fastify from v4 to v5, so if you're
running CedarJS in a serverful environment you should look through your Fastify
specific code.

Note: For v5 Fastify changed how you pass in a custom logger. CedarJS already
had that code somewhat customized, so for this PR we kept the unified `logger`
option we already had, so there should be no change for you in that regards,
but we will probably break this appart in the future to match what Fastify is
doing

See [the Fastify v5 migration docs](https://fastify.dev/docs/latest/Guides/Migration-Guide-V5/)
for all the details.
