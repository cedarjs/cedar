- feat(api-server): lambdaLoader: add discoverFunctionsGlob option (#189) by @Tobbe

For function discovery in createServer and related modules.

Allows overriding the glob used to discover functions, which is required when a different bundler is used, or the directory structure is not the default `dist/functions/`

Defaults to: `'dist/functions/**/*.{ts,js}'`
