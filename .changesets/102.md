- feat(clerk): Switch to `@clerk/backend` SDK (#102) by @Tobbe

The @clerk/clerk-sdk-node package has reached its
[end of support](https://clerk.com/changelog/2025-01-10-node-sdk-eol) back in
January. This PR updates the Clerk auth provider to use the recommended JS
Backend SDK (@clerk/backend).

# Breaking changes

- Removes the deprecated `authDecoder` function which used the rate-limited API
  and relied on the now unsupported Node SDK.
- You now have to specify `process.env.CLERK_API_URL`, it no longer has a
  default fallback
