# Security Policy

The Redmix repo is scanned frequently for code and dependency vulnerabilities. Notifications are received by the Redmix Team, who assess risk, prioritize, and determine a remediation plan. Typically this process involves a package update or patch release and is resolved as soon as possible.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a potential security issue, do let us know as soon as possible. We'll work toward a resolution as quickly as possible, so please provide us with a reasonable amount of time before disclosure to the public or a third-party.

There are two ways to contact us:

1. Email [tobbe@tlundberg.com](mailto:tobbe@tlundberg.com), or
2. Use GitHub's private [Vulnerability Reporting feature](https://github.com/redmix-run/redmix/security/advisories) (to learn how this works, [click here](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/security-advisories/repository-security-advisories/configuring-private-vulnerability-reporting-for-a-repository))

Thank you for helping improve Redmix security!

## Security is Everyone's Responsibility

We take security seriously. Which is why we offer a friendly reminder that "Redmix Framework Security" **!=** "Security of Applications built with Redmix"

It's our responsibility (Redmix Team members) to implement security best practices and make the framework as secure as possible. We will do as much as we can; however, we can only do so much. Ultimately, security rests in the hands of the application developers who use Redmix. If you haven't already, we recommend starting the security process for your application with [GitHub's Security Tools and Best Practices](https://docs.github.com/en/github/managing-security-vulnerabilities/managing-security-vulnerabilities-in-your-project).
