# Cedar Router

This is the built-in router for Cedar apps. It takes inspiration from Ruby on Rails, React Router, and Reach Router, but is very opinionated in its own way.

Cedar Router is designed to list all routes in a single file, with limited nesting. We prefer this design, as it makes it very easy to track which routes map to which pages.
