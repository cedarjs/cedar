# ESLint Plugin

Custom ESLint plugins used for standalone CedarJS ESLint lint rules.
These rules are ment to be consumed via the larger
[`@cedarjs/eslint-config`](https://github.com/cedarjs/cedar/tree/main/packages/eslint-config).

## Contributing

This package doesn't depend on other Cedar Framework packages.
To contribute, you should be familiar with the ESLint package.
Keep in mind that any rules added should not conflict with code formatting
tools (e.g.
[Prettier](https://prettier.io/docs/en/integrating-with-linters.html)).
