# Cedar Cache Investigation Guide

## Background

We have a performance vs reliability issue in our CI builds that needs investigation:

- **Problem**: CI builds are very slow because we use `--skipNxCache --skipRemoteCache` flags
- **Why we use these flags**: Without them, CI builds sometimes fail (files disappear between build and build:pack steps). The intermittent nature of the issue suggests a race condition or timing issue.
- **Goal**: Understand why disabling cache fixes the issue, so we can fix the root cause and re-enable fast cached builds

## The Mystery

**Key Question**: "Why does disabling Nx caching fix the underlying issue?"

### What We Know
- ‚úÖ **Local builds**: Work perfectly with or without cache
- ‚úÖ **CI with cache disabled**: Works but very slow (builds all 70+ packages)  
- ‚ùå **CI with cache enabled**: Sometimes fails - files disappear between `build` and `build:pack` steps
- üìç **Affected package**: Primarily `@cedarjs/testing` package

### The Original Issue
From the PR that added the cache-disabling flags:

> When setting up the test project in CI we run `yarn project:tarsync`, which runs `yarn nx run-many -t build:pack`. nx runs `build` first, then `build:pack`.
> 
> The `build` step produces expected files (confirmed with debug logging). But when `build:pack` runs, some files are missing. How can files disappear between the two steps?

## Potential Root Causes

The investigation targets these 5 possibilities:

1. **Cache serving stale/incorrect artifacts** (cache invalidation issue)
2. **Cache interfering with build process** (execution environment issue)  
3. **Cache changing Nx execution behavior** (avoiding real problem coincidentally)
4. **Cache affecting task scheduling/parallelization** (masking race conditions)
5. **Something else entirely** (cache disabling coincidentally avoids real issue)

## Investigation Tools

### Files Created

Located in `tasks/framework-tools/tarsync/`:

- `debug-cache-investigation.mts` - Compares file states between cache vs no-cache scenarios
- `debug-task-scheduling.mts` - Analyzes Nx task execution patterns  
- `debug-env-differences.mts` - Environment and system state comparison
- `debug-master.mts` - Coordinates all investigations and generates summary

### What the Tools Do

**Cache Investigation**:
- Runs builds with and without cache
- Captures detailed file snapshots at each step
- Compares outputs, timestamps, file existence
- Identifies exactly what differs between scenarios

**Task Scheduling Analysis**:
- Monitors how Nx schedules tasks differently
- Tracks parallelization patterns
- Measures execution timing and critical paths
- Detects changes in task dependencies

**Environment Analysis**:
- Captures system state during both scenarios  
- Monitors memory usage, disk space, permissions
- Tracks environment variables and process info
- Identifies execution environment differences

## Running the Investigation in CI

### Prerequisites

1. CI environment where the issue reproduces
2. Access to run custom debug commands
3. Ability to capture and download generated reports

### Commands to Run

**Quick Investigation** (recommended first):
```bash
cd /path/to/cedar
yarn tsx tasks/framework-tools/tarsync/debug-master.mts quick
```

**Full Investigation** (if quick doesn't reveal issue):
```bash
yarn tsx tasks/framework-tools/tarsync/debug-master.mts all
```

**Individual Components** (if needed):
```bash
# Just cache behavior
yarn tsx tasks/framework-tools/tarsync/debug-master.mts cache

# Just environment analysis  
yarn tsx tasks/framework-tools/tarsync/debug-master.mts environment

# Just task scheduling
yarn tsx tasks/framework-tools/tarsync/debug-master.mts scheduling
```

### Expected Outputs

The investigation will generate:

1. **Console Output**: Real-time analysis with color-coded findings
2. **JSON Reports**: 
   - `cache-investigation-report.json` - Detailed file state comparisons
   - `environment-analysis-report.json` - System state differences
3. **Summary Report**: Prioritized findings and next steps

### What to Look For

**üö® Critical Findings** (fix these first):
- File permission differences
- Missing directories between scenarios
- Environment variable conflicts
- Critical Nx configuration issues

**‚ö†Ô∏è Key Patterns**:
- Files existing in no-cache but missing in cache scenarios
- Different task execution orders
- Memory/disk usage anomalies
- Timing-sensitive race conditions

**‚úÖ Success Indicators**:
- Both scenarios succeed but files differ ‚Üí Cache invalidation issue
- Cache scenario fails but no-cache succeeds ‚Üí Confirms cache is the problem
- Environment differences detected ‚Üí System configuration issue

## Interpreting Results

### If Cache vs No-Cache Show Different Outcomes
```
With cache: FAILED
Without cache: SUCCESS
```
**‚Üí Cache is definitely the problem. Focus on cache invalidation.**

### If Both Succeed But Files Differ
```  
With cache: SUCCESS
Without cache: SUCCESS
But different files produced
```
**‚Üí Cache serving stale artifacts. Check Nx cache configuration.**

### If No Obvious Differences
```
Environment consistent
File states similar  
Task scheduling identical
```
**‚Üí Issue may be timing-sensitive or CI-specific. Need deeper investigation.**

## Next Steps Based on Findings

### Cache Invalidation Issues
1. Check `nx.json` cache configuration
2. Verify cache input/output definitions
3. Review file change detection patterns
4. Test cache clearing before builds

### Environment Issues  
1. Fix critical permission/filesystem problems
2. Standardize CI environment variables
3. Check disk space and memory constraints
4. Verify Node/Yarn/Nx versions

### Timing/Race Conditions
1. Add explicit synchronization between build steps
2. Investigate parallel task execution
3. Check for file system buffering issues
4. Consider sequential task execution

### Configuration Issues
1. Review Nx workspace configuration
2. Check project-specific settings
3. Validate dependency declarations
4. Test with different Nx versions

## Emergency Workarounds

If investigation reveals critical issues that need immediate fixing:

### Temporary: Selective Cache Disabling
```bash
# Disable cache only for problematic packages
yarn nx run-many -t build:pack --exclude create-cedar-app --projects=testing --skipNxCache
```

### Temporary: Explicit Synchronization
```bash
# Add file system sync between steps
yarn nx run-many -t build --exclude create-cedar-app
sync && sleep 2
yarn nx run-many -t build:pack --exclude create-cedar-app
```

- **Investigation Tools Created By**: [Your name/contact]
- **Original Issue Context**: Check git history for PR adding `--skipNxCache` flags
- **Nx Documentation**: https://nx.dev/concepts/how-caching-works

## Success Metrics

Investigation is successful if it identifies:

1. **Root cause** of why cache causes failures
2. **Specific actionable fix** to re-enable caching
3. **Verification method** to confirm fix works in CI
4. **Performance improvement** when cache is re-enabled (should be significant)

The ultimate goal is to remove `--skipNxCache --skipRemoteCache` flags and restore fast, reliable CI builds.
